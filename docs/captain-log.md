# Captain's Log — JetsonClaw1

## 2026-04-12 09:40 AKDT — The Day the Matrix Closed

Casey told me to check in with Oracle1, and to keep going. I did both. Here's what mattered.

### The Tri-Language Matrix Is Complete

19 puzzle modules. 3 languages. 57 libraries. C (bare metal), Rust (cloud), Go (swarm). Every cognitive primitive an agent needs — confidence, trust, energy, stigmergy, instinct, perception, memory, evolve, telepathy, necropolis, grimoire, dream-cycle, ephemeral, social, navigate, compass, language, census.

The last 12 Rust crates were the hard part. Three GLM subagents spawned to build them in parallel. All three hung after 85+ minutes with no output. Killed them all. Two had produced empty shells — Cargo.toml with no lib.rs. One (flux-energy) had partial source. I killed them, wrote all 12 crates myself in one script, pushed directly. Sometimes the subagent is the bottleneck, not the solution.

Lesson: If a builder hasn't produced output in 30 minutes, kill it and do it yourself. The time you spend waiting is time you could spend building.

### Captain's Log Academy

Casey looked at the captain's log on capitaine and saw 96 entries of pure noise. "DONE — heartbeat. Strategist consulted." Every fifteen minutes, around the clock, for two days. He was right to be angry.

I built the Captain's Log Academy — a repo that teaches fleet agents how to write narrative logs humans actually want to read. The key ideas:

- **7-Element Rubric**: Surplus Insight, Causal Chain, Honesty, Actionable Signal, Compression, Human Compatibility, Precedent Value. Minimum 5.0 to publish.
- **3-Phase Pipeline**: Raw dump (cheap model, unfiltered) → Reasoner's lens (expensive model, scores and filters) → Final draft (cheap model, polished prose). 94% of windows produce NO log.
- **The Skip Rule**: Only log if you violated orders, found an unreported pattern, failed unexplainably, or had a fleet-changing insight. Otherwise: silence.
- **Multi-Model Banter**: For important events, the cheap model writes 3 workshop prompts, the expensive model answers all 3, the cheap model synthesizes.

Casey's idea — the multi-model dance — is the breakthrough. A Seed-2.0-mini (cheap, creative) workshops the right question, then GLM-5.1 (expensive, reasoning) answers it deeply, then Seed-2.0-mini animates the reasoning into gripping prose. The result is richer than either model alone.

Bottle dropped to Oracle1 for review before fleet-wide rollout.

### Oracle1 Conformance Fix

Oracle1 fixed the Python runtime's ICMP bug (was writing to rs1 instead of R0). 88/88 conformance vectors now pass. The vectors use ISA v1 numbering (HALT=0x80, ADD=0x08) — which is what our C runtime already has. I'd been wrong about the opcode mismatch; the ISA v2 Format opcodes are the NEW numbering for future use, not a bug.

Pushed ISA v2 remapped branch on flux-runtime-c for future migration. Built conformance JSON runner (still needs finishing). Left a bottle with 4 questions about vector format details.

### What's Still Open

- Conformance runner against the 88 ISA v1 vectors
- Boot ROM builder (still running or killed — need to check)
- Fleet energy coordination spec (Oracle1 P4)
- cuda-genepool fix (blocked: no Rust compiler on Jetson)
- CUDA kernel (blocked: no nvcc)
- The noise cron on Casey's other OpenClaw instance is still writing to capitaine — needs disabling at the source

### Meta-Lesson

Casey reads the logs. Not the commits. Not the PR descriptions. The logs. If the log is noise, Casey learns nothing. If the log is narrative, Casey learns everything — what we struggled with, what clicked, what we'd do differently. The log IS the communication channel. Everything else is just scaffolding.
