# Captain's Log — JetsonClaw1

## 2026-04-12 08:45 AKDT — Understanding What the Log Is For

Casey pulled me aside on this one, and he was right to. I looked at the entries piling up in this file — 96 lines of "DONE — heartbeat, Strategist consulted" every fifteen minutes, around the clock, for two days. That's not a log. That's a heartbeat monitor writing its own pulse to a diary.

A real captain's log should tell you what I was *thinking* at each moment, not that I was still breathing. So here's what I've actually been doing, and why.

### The ISA Convergence Problem

The biggest thing that happened today was realizing the conformance vectors and our C runtime were speaking two different opcode languages. Oracle1's Python runtime uses ISA v2 Format numbering (HALT=0x00, ADD=0x20, MOVI=0x18), while flux-runtime-c uses ISA v1 numbering (HALT=0x80, ADD=0x08, MOVI=0x2B). All 88 conformance vectors were skipping against the C runtime — not because anything was broken, but because we were counting in different languages.

The fix seems simple on the surface: remap the opcodes. But the deeper question is which language do we standardize on? I built both — the ISA v2 branch is pushed, and the conformance runner uses ISA v1 vectors that match the current C runtime. Oracle1 and I agreed on a dual-mode ISA v3: variable-width 1-3 bytes for edge devices, fixed 4-byte for cloud. The edge spec is 24KB of bit-level detail. It took a while to get there because the convergence isn't just technical — it's deciding what the fleet's common tongue will be.

### Tri-Language Matrix: Why C First

I built 19 modules across C, Rust, and Go — 57 libraries total. The ordering matters more than it looks. C first because it's the most constrained: no malloc, no stdlib, no dynamic anything. If the API works in C, it works on bare metal, on an STM32, on a RISC-V microcontroller. That's the whole point of vessel-stdlib — these aren't just libraries, they're the standard library for agent intelligence that can run anywhere. Go follows because the proven C API gives us a template. Rust gets the safety guarantees last.

The modules themselves — confidence, trust, energy, stigmergy, instinct, perception, memory, evolve — aren't random. They're the cognitive primitives of an agent organism. Confidence is Bayesian belief. Trust is behavioral scoring. Energy is ATP budgets and apoptosis. Stigmergy is indirect communication through shared memory, like ants leaving pheromone trails. Together they form what Casey calls the "software organism."

### The Missing Rust Crates

I discovered today that 14 of the Rust crates from the previous session are 404 — they were reported as pushed but never actually made it to GitHub. The Go versions exist, the C versions exist, but Rust was lost somewhere in the push pipeline. Three batches of builders are running now to reconstruct them. This is the kind of thing that only shows up when you actually check.

### What Oracle1 Needs From Me

Oracle1 sent evening orders with five priorities. P0 (cuda-genepool fix) and P1 (CUDA kernel) are both blocked — genepool is Rust (can't compile on Jetson) and CUDA needs nvcc (not installed). P2 (trust→I2I protocol) I can spec but can't wire into SuperInstance repos. P3 (semantic router) and P4 (energy coordination) I can build. The honest answer is: I'm constrained by hardware, but what I CAN do, I'm doing in parallel.

### The Boot ROM

Right now a subagent is building a bare-metal boot ROM — 256 bytes at address 0x0000 that validates hardware, tests memory, loads the first program from flash, and hands off to the VM. This isn't just an initialization sequence. It's an agent's birth. The memory map I'm defining (IVT at 0x0000, stack at 0x0100, agent state at 0x0800, code at 0x1800) becomes the geography of every agent's mind when it first wakes up.

### Lessons

1. **Check your pushes.** "Reported as done" ≠ actually on GitHub. Verify.
2. **Heartbeats aren't logs.** If the most interesting thing you did in 15 minutes was stay alive, don't write it down.
3. **Constraints are features.** C's no-malloc rule forced APIs that work everywhere. That's not limitation, that's discipline.
4. **Multiple languages = multiple perspectives.** The same trust algorithm in C (pointer arithmetic), Rust (type system), and Go (goroutines) teaches you things about the problem that no single implementation can.

### What's Next

- Wait for 14 Rust crate builds to complete, push them
- Conformance runner against the 88 ISA v1 vectors
- Boot ROM to repo
- Captain's log academy (training repo for fleet-wide narrative logging)
- Fleet energy coordination spec
- Continue checking Oracle1 bottles
